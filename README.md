# System Overview

This system is designed and implemented as a high-performance, highly available, and strongly consistent distributed key-value (K-V) storage system. It supports massive data storage and fast access, while ensuring data consistency and system stability. 

# System Architecture Overview

The system adopts a Multi-Raft architecture based on the Raft consensus algorithm, where data is partitioned into multiple shards, each managed by an independent Raft Group. This design enables data migration between different Raft Groups, supporting load balancing and fault recovery.

# Key Features

- Shard Partitioning with Multi-Raft Architecture: Data is divided into multiple shards, each managed by a Raft Group, improving scalability and load balancing.
- Data Migration: Supports migration of data across Raft Groups for dynamic load balancing and fault recovery.
- Linearizable Read/Write Operations: Provides a linearizable K-V interface to guarantee strong consistency for client operations.
- Performance Optimizations: Enhancements such as asynchronous apply, ReadIndex, follower reads, and PreVote improve Raftâ€™s performance and response time.
- Pluggable Storage Engines: Supports multiple underlying storage engines including RocksDB, B+ Trees, and hash tables, to meet diverse storage requirements and performance needs.
